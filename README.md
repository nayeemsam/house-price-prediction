Introduction
The House Price Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate house prices. The model is trained on a dataset containing various attributes of houses, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: Download the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended): Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Install the required dependencies: Install the necessary Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook on your machine and open houseprice.ipynb.

Run the notebook: Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to understand the processes of data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Modify the code: Feel free to modify the notebook to experiment with different models or add new features to improve the model's performance.
